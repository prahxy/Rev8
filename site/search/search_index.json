With this was a relatively easy modification to make with the Microshift Sword Drivetrain.  I was able to maintain the dropper post capability because the Microshift Sword Drivetrain offers a left brake lever with a dropper post lever.   This conversion was a lot cheaper than if I would have went with a SRAM AXS mullet, and it confirms that another drop bar bike is somewhere in my future, whether it's a drop bar mountain bike, or a more capable gravel bike.  Recently I had a tune up on the bike done by my friend Bobby Finster at Poke Bayou Outfitters, and this bike should treat me well for this event.</p> <ul> <li>2022 Specialized Rockhopper</li> <li>Microshift Sword Brifters w/ 1x Microshift Advent X Drivetrain</li> <li>28t Endless Cycles Chainring</li> <li>Teravail Sparwood \"Durable\" 29x2.2\" Tires</li> <li>Coros Dura Cycling Computer</li> <li>I love this bike computer sooooo much.
