# Pre-Arkansas Graveler Prep

## Bike Specs

The bike I will be riding is a Specialized Rockhopper that I modified to be a "Drophopper", a drop-bar version of the Specialized Rockhopper.  With this was a relatively easy modification to make with the Microshift Sword Drivetrain.  I was able to maintain the dropper post capability because the Microshift Sword Drivetrain offers a left brake lever with a dropper post lever.   This conversion was a lot cheaper than if I would have went with a SRAM AXS mullet, and it confirms that another drop bar bike is somewhere in my future, whether it's a drop bar mountain bike, or a more capable gravel bike.  Recently I had a tune up on the bike done by my friend Bobby Finster at Poke Bayou Outfitters, and this bike should treat me well for this event.

- 2022 Specialized Rockhopper
- Microshift Sword Brifters w/ 1x Microshift Advent X Drivetrain
- 28t Endless Cycles Chainring
- Teravail Sparwood "Durable" 29x2.2" Tires
- Coros Dura Cycling Computer
  - I love this bike computer sooooo much.  It's honestly one of the best pieces of gear I've purchased.

### Packing List

The Arkansas Graveler is a supported Gravel experience.  I get to pack all of my gear in a 27 gallon tote, that gets a (probably) luxurious truck ride from host city to host city.  This will allow me to pack differently than if I was truly bikepacking this route.

- Sleep Kit
  - Eureka 2p Midori Tent
        - I bought this back in around 2016 on clearance at Fleet Farm, and it hasn't gotten nearly enough use.  It's not great for bikepacking due to its size, but, for this event I don't have to carry it.
  - Thermarest Sleeping Pad and Big Agnes Air Mattress
    - An inflatable pillow I was given for Christmas from the in-laws.  It'll do.
    - Some sort of high temp quilt/bag that needs to be purchased.  I'm not worried about Arkansas June evening temperatures.

- Bike Equipment
  - One Up EDC V2 Mutlitool &  100cc Pump
    - I have one of these on every bike I own.  Enough said.
  - Extra Muc Off Tubeless Sealant
  - Muc Off Chain Lube
  - Spare Inner Tubes
  - Tire Repair Stuff

- On-Bike Apparrel
- Cycling Bibs
  - I feel like I'm not educated enough, or experienced enough on cycling bibs to have a strong opinion on these.  I did have to purchase some new bibs for this event, as I only owned a couple pairs. I am purchasing GoreWear SWIFTRIDE Optical Bib Shorts and hope they will keep me comfy for the 270+ miles of cycling I'll be doing.
- An Assortment of cycling jerseys/UPF Shirts
- An Assortment of merino wool socks
- An old Columbia PFG rain jacket
- Mechanics Gloves
